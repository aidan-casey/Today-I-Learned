# DVD Taking Forever to Load in VLC

If a DVD is taking forever to load in VLC, you can attempt to resolve this issue by following the steps below.

```
In VLC go to Tools > Preferences > Input/Codecs > Show All (bottom radio button) > Input/Codecs (again, in the left list) > Advanced (category on the right) > File cache (ms)
You should see 300ms by default.
Change it to 1000ms.
Save your change.
```
