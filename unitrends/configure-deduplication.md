# Configure Deduplication

Unitrends has three modes of deduplication.

1. No Deduplication (Compression and Hashing Only)
2. Post Process Deduplication (Compression First, Deduplication Later)
3. Advanced Adaptive Deduplication (Deduplication on Arrival and Synthesis)

Unitrends recommends #3 as long as the hardware can handle it.

To set the deduplication level, select the settings icon in the top-right corner, click **DEDUPLICATION SETTINGS** and select **Level 3 (Optimized for retention)**.
